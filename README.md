# Data-Augmentation-Pytorch
Data-Augmentation example based on torchsample
---
---
## 1. Introduction.
This is an example which adopts [torchsample](https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample)  package to implement data augmentation. This package provides many data augmentation methods such as rotation, zoom in or out.
## 2. Demo
The CIFAR-10 classification task is used to show how to utilize this package to implement data augmentation.

### 2.1. Accuracy.
The final accuracy is shown as follows:

| Network        | Baselines           | Data Augmentation/(Rotation)  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| AlexNet (No pretrained)     | 
| AlexNet (No pretrained)      | 

### 2.2. Convergence Curve.

## 3.  Acknowledgement.

The  [torchsample](https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample)  is a very awesome package implemented by [Nick Cullen](https://github.com/ncullen93).
